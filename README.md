# Tech-Assessment-V4.0-ICU-Predicting-Tool-
Log Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest have been utilised to assess new input parameters, to judge the survival rates.


Please develop 3 machine learning models (logistic regression, decision tree and random forest) (need not be optimized) to predict the survival of each patient using Python in a Jupyter notebook. Thereafter, deploy the 3 models where non-technical user may enter the parameters for a new patient to predict the survival rate.

The dataset may be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ukveteran/icu-patients (Kaggle account is required).
